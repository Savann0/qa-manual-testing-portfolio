 Test Cases

This folder contains documented manual test cases for the OrangeHRM demo application.

Each test case includes:
- Test case ID, name, and short description

- Step-by-step actions
- Test data
- Expected response vs actual results
- Pass/Fail decision and comments

Test cases are written in a structured table format (similar to academic/manual QA documentation).
